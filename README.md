# Tower-Of-Hanoi-Reinforcement-Learning
# Introduction

The following is an implementation of a RL SARSA Agent that can learn to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. The template code for the SARSA agent and Q comes from https://github.com/clarisli/RL-Easy21 and it was adapted to the Tower of Hanoi environment. 

The code can be used for educational purposes, i.e., teaching RL. The environment was implemented in an intuitive way, that is, through a dictionary of 3 lists to represent the 3 rods.
