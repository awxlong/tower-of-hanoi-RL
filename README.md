# tower-of-hanoi-RL
# Introduction

The following is an implementation of a RL SARSA Agent that can learn to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. The template code comes from https://github.com/clarisli/RL-Easy21 and it was adapted to this problem. 

The code can be used for educational purposes, i.e., teaching RL. The environment was implemented in an intuitive way, that is, through a dictionary of 3 lists to represent the 3 rods.
